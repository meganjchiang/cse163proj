3848,m/baywatch_2017,Baywatch,"Action & Adventure, Comedy",Kevin Maher,0.2,2017-05-22,"It's eerily similar to the TV show, but not strictly in content or execution... No, what the film-makers have captured and emulated is the TV show's trademark combination of conspicuous sleaze and formal naivety.",1
3849,m/baywatch_2017,Baywatch,"Action & Adventure, Comedy",Bill Goodykoontz,0.4,2017-05-23,"Johnson is as likable an actor as there is, and it's to the actors' credit that they buy in to the stupidity. But there aren't enough laughs and not nearly enough story.",2

3851,m/baywatch_2017,Baywatch,"Action & Adventure, Comedy",Michael Phillips,0.375,2017-05-23,"The movie is all preening and very few laughs, though Daddario and Efron have a few moments, and Johnson remains a supremely likable slab of movie star.",2
3852,m/baywatch_2017,Baywatch,"Action & Adventure, Comedy",Jack Shepherd,0.4,2017-05-23,"Having attempted to replicate what Jump Street did right, the writers of Baywatch seemingly understand very little about what made Lord and Miller's films genuinely hilarious, going for crass jokes containing very little intelligence.",2
3853,m/baywatch_2017,Baywatch,"Action & Adventure, Comedy",Joshua Rothkopf,0.8,2017-05-23,"The generous -- radical? -- thing about Hollywood's version of the tush-ogling '90s TV phenomenon is that, pretty quickly, it makes you feel in on the joke.",4
3854,m/baywatch_2017,Baywatch,"Action & Adventure, Comedy",Katie Walsh,0.375,2017-05-23,"This bombastic reboot, directed incompetently by Seth Gordon, is held together with nothing more than hopes, dreams and neoprene, and inevitably, all of those systems fail.",2
3857,m/baywatch_2017,Baywatch,"Action & Adventure, Comedy",Patrick Smith,0.4,2017-05-23,"Ultimately, this film should have been left in the beach hut, and certainly not encouraged to step on to the sand.",2
3858,m/baywatch_2017,Baywatch,"Action & Adventure, Comedy",Stephen Whitty,0.5,2017-05-23,"Even as it adds R-rated language and nudity, ""Baywatch"" remains as out of touch as an old Playboy party joke.",3

3860,m/baywatch_2017,Baywatch,"Action & Adventure, Comedy",Steve Rose,0.2,2017-05-23,"By about halfway in, the gags dry up and the story sinks like an overweight tourist who took a dip too early after the all-you-can-eat surf'n'turf buffet.",1
3861,m/baywatch_2017,Baywatch,"Action & Adventure, Comedy",Brian Truitt,0.5,2017-05-23,"Has its share of hilarious moments but never fully commits to the absurd, and even the cleverest jokes get so many callbacks, they're beating a dead seahorse.",3
3862,m/baywatch_2017,Baywatch,"Action & Adventure, Comedy",Tom Russo,0.5,2017-05-24,"Which is it, ""Baywatch"" team - winkingly sly, or flat-out silly?",3
3863,m/baywatch_2017,Baywatch,"Action & Adventure, Comedy",Rafer Guzman,0.75,2017-05-24,A raunchy but good-natured adaptation of the preposterous 1990s television show.,4
3864,m/baywatch_2017,Baywatch,"Action & Adventure, Comedy",Mick LaSalle,0.5,2017-05-24,"Something either went wrong or didn't go right enough.

3865,m/baywatch_2017,Baywatch,"Action & Adventure, Comedy",Geoffrey Macnab,0.4,2017-05-24,Baywatch is an exercise is self-reflexive irony and kitsch. It's mocking the original TV series -- which seems pretty pointless given that the series was tongue in cheek anyway.,2
3866,m/baywatch_2017,Baywatch,"Action & Adventure, Comedy",Glenn Kenny,0.375,2017-05-24,A full feature with a storyline that an enterprising six-year-old might have thought was a little too rudimentary.,2
3868,m/baywatch_2017,Baywatch,"Action & Adventure, Comedy",Mark Daniell,0.5,2017-05-25,"Baywatch the TV show was never particularly memorable. But save for a few penis jokes, Baywatch the movie serves as a reminder that sometimes an unremarkable past is better left alone.",3
3870,m/baywatch_2017,Baywatch,"Action & Adventure, Comedy",Kate Taylor,0.375,2017-05-25,Mainly this ridiculous thing lurches from genre to genre without director Seth Gordon ever establishing a credible threat.,2

3878,m/baywatch_2017,Baywatch,"Action & Adventure, Comedy",Peter Travers,0.5,2017-05-26,"The Rock is fun to watch, for a while at least. The rest is one big fat wallow in instant stupid.",3
3879,m/baywatch_2017,Baywatch,"Action & Adventure, Comedy",James Berardinelli,0.25,2017-05-26,"An example of lazy writing and direction with the vague hope that perhaps the involvement of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson will attract viewers.",2
