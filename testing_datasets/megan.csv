9653,m/entourage,Entourage,Comedy,Ann Hornaday,0.125,2015-06-02,"As he did in the show, Ari single-handedly saves the movie version of Entourage from ""Medellin""-scale disaster.",1
9654,m/entourage,Entourage,Comedy,Linda Barnard,0.375,2015-06-02,"To Ellin's credit, Entourage looks good and has liberal amounts of flash. But it is a fly trapped in amber, celebrating excess and male privilege in a sexist way that feels very old and decidedly out of step with the 2015 world.",2
9655,m/entourage,Entourage,Comedy,Bill Goodykoontz,0.6,2015-06-02,"The big-screen version of Entourage is constructed like the series, another chapter in a sequel-ready story. If you wanted something more, you won't get it. But you will get this, and if it does well, likely more of it.",3
9657,m/entourage,Entourage,Comedy,Joe Neumaier,0.6,2015-06-02,"Entourage plays like a solid, if slightly too long, episode. But even given the bloat, the cast's easy camaraderie and a ""play it as it lays"" atmosphere wins you over.",3
9658,m/entourage,Entourage,Comedy,Philippa Hawker,0.5,2015-06-02,"There are traces of what made the TV series entertaining, but not enough to sustain a movie.",3

9661,m/entourage,Entourage,Comedy,Michael Phillips,0.5,2015-06-02,"Devoted fans of the HBO series (2004-2011) will find it passably engaging, and newcomers will likely stare at the inside-Hollywood tropes and panic attacks the way Nipper the RCA dog stared at the Victrola.",3
9662,m/entourage,Entourage,Comedy,Mick LaSalle,0.75,2015-06-02,"Four years after its eight seasons as an HBO series, ""Entourage"" is back as a feature film, and the first thing that needs to be said is that you don't have to know the show to enjoy the movie.",4

9665,m/entourage,Entourage,Comedy,David Ehrlich,0.2,2015-06-02,"In 2015, however, bros only come before hos alphabetically, and what once felt like an innocent tale of wish fulfillment now plays like the masturbatory fantasy of a men's-rights activist.",1
9667,m/entourage,Entourage,Comedy,Brian Tallerico,0.375,2015-06-02,"A film that keeps its audience at a distance, never surprising them at all narratively and barely moving the needle for its characters. It is fan fiction in film form.",2
9668,m/entourage,Entourage,Comedy,James Berardinelli,0.5,2015-06-03,"There are some amusing moments but, like the TV series, Entourage is more interested in getting chuckles than guffaws. Maybe we should be thankful - at least the comedy isn't embarrassingly over-the-top.",3
9670,m/entourage,Entourage,Comedy,Peter Keough,0.25,2015-06-03,"The film is stuck in the inconsequential rut of the series. The characters are static, and the comedy is situational rather than dramatic.",2

9674,m/entourage,Entourage,Comedy,Peter Travers,0.625,2015-06-04,"Was there a crying need for a film version of Entourage? Hardly. But the movie is still a tribute to Piven's iconic performance as Ari Gold, a devil you can love.",4
