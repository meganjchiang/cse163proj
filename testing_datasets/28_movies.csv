m/1000_times_good_night,"1,000 Times Good Night",Drama,Glenn Kenny,0.625,2015-08-07,"If I'm complaining about this movie a lot for one I'm deeming better than fair, it's because I was frustrated by how its first-rate ingredients, Binoche chief among them, somehow failed to create a spectacular end result.",4
m/1003399-calamity_jane,Calamity Jane,"Classics, Comedy, Musical & Performing Arts, Western, Romance",Peter Bradshaw,1.0,2016-04-07,"The tunes are gold, and as Jane approaches a local creek, resplendent in her gorgeous yellow gown, we get one of the most famous visual gags in the history of the musical.",5
m/1003757-cat_people,Cat People,"Drama, Horror, Romance",Kate Muir,0.8,2016-10-03,"I do like a film that opens with a mission statement, and...

m/1007977-fun_with_dick_and_jane,Fun with Dick and Jane,Comedy,Roger Ebert,0.625,2018-07-02,"This stuff is funny enough, but somehow it's too easy. It's situation comedy, when the movie's earlier moments seemed to be promising us a hard-boiled commentary...",4
m/1008080-gambler,The Gambler,"Classics, Drama",Roger Ebert,1.0,2018-04-29,"Reisz, Caan, and screenwriter James Toback have constructed the character and the movie so convincingly that the scene not only works, but works two ways: first as suspense, and then as character revelation.",5
m/1009123-hamlet,Hamlet,"Classics, Drama",Kate Cameron,1.0,2016-02-23,"Altogether Hamlet is one of the most impressive films ever made and, so far as Shakespeare's work is concerned, it need never be done again on stage nor for the screen, as the Olivier production... may stand for all time as THE Hamlet.",5

m/1010448-in_cold_blood,In Cold Blood,Drama,Peter Bradshaw,0.8,2015-09-10,"Capote's non-fiction novel brooded on the sheer pointless nightmare, and so does the film, to some extent; the killers' casual excitement at the prospect of murderous violence is still chilling.",4

m/sicario_2015,Sicario,"Action & Adventure, Drama, Mystery & Suspense",Matthew Lickona,0.4,2015-09-25,"Throughout, Villeneuve excels at approaching the carnage to come from a great, safe distance, and the message seems clear: here is a problem of vast scope and scale, being engaged by huge and complicated forces, and here are its intimate, bloody effects.",2
m/sicario_day_of_the_soldado,Sicario: Day of the Soldado,"Action & Adventure, Drama",Matthew Lickona,0.0,2018-06-29,"As if in imitation of the ruthless Mexican drug cartel its heroes go after, director Stefano Sollima's sequel decapitates, disembowels, and castrates Denis Villeneuve's beautiful, tough, and sad 2015 original.",1

m/some_kind_of_beautiful,Some Kind of Beautiful,Comedy,Liz Braun,0.4,2015-08-20,"Sometimes, [the film] wants to be light farce, all repartee and two-dimensional characters; other times it wants to be a contender, with deathbed scenes and motivating lectures on romantic poetry. At all times it's a tremendous waste of talent.",2

m/sonic_the_hedgehog_2020,Sonic the Hedgehog,"Action & Adventure, Comedy",Brian Truitt,0.5,2020-02-12,"The film is fine, familiar fare for gamers and children: Sonic sprints, Carrey mugs, but the creative juices run out quickly.",3
